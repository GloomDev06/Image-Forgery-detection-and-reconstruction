# Image-Forgery-detection-and-reconstruction

Image forgery detection and reconstruction involves spotting fake parts in pictures and restoring them to their original form. Detecting fakes usually means looking for oddities like inconsistent colors or weird shadows. Advanced methods use smart computer programs that learn from lots of real and fake images to find the fakes automatically. Once a fake is found, the next step is fixing it. This often means using fancy math to guess what the original picture looked like based on the parts around the fake one. The tricky part is that fakers keep getting better, so scientists are always working on smarter ways to find and fix fakes. These techniques are super important for things like catching digital cheats or making sure news pictures are real.
